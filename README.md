# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was focused on generating code that can perform the following tasks:

- Generate a random list of longitude and latitudes
- Use the OpenWeather API to identify the closest city and extract realtime weather data from these cities
- Assemble the city/weather information into a dataframe
- Determine hotels that are closest to the cities in our list
- Use Google Maps API to provide pop ups at the locations in our list with hotel and weather information
- Use Google Directions API to provide a travel route for select cities of interest
